# **RotoGuru Daily Fantasy Scrapper**

This is a simple python command line utility to scrape data from rotogur1.com. Currently only baseball is supported. 

Why would RotoGuru try to sell access to this data if they are going to make it *so* easy to simply scrape?

## **Usage**

For example, to download DrafKings data from June 6, 2019 and save to the path /data:

`> python rotogur/download_bb.py 6 6 2019 --site DraftKings --path /data`
